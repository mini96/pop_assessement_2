# Transportation Logistics System - MIS501 Assessment 2


**Due Date:** April 13, 2025

## Overview
This Python program implements a Transportation Logistics System with three main modules:
1. Fleet Management (Skeleton - To Be Implemented)
2. Shipment Management (Fully Implemented)
3. Delivery Management (Skeleton - To Be Implemented)

The code uses only Python 3 features covered in Modules 1.1-4.2 and follows PEP 8 style guidelines.

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed
2. Run the program from command line:


## Program Structure

### Main Menu Options:
1. Fleet Management
2. Shipment Management
3. Delivery Management
4. Quit

### Fleet Management (To Implement)
Complete these functions in `solution.py`:
- Add Vehicle: Validate unique vehicle_id and positive capacity
- Update Vehicle: Check existence before updating
- Remove Vehicle: Add confirmation prompt
- View Vehicles: Display in clean tabular format

### Shipment Management (Complete)
Ready-to-use features:
- Create shipments with validation
- Track shipment status
- View all shipments

### Delivery Management (To Implement)
Implement these features:
- Record deliveries with validation
- Check delivery status
- Update shipment status

## Development Guidelines

1. **Input Validation**:
- All user inputs must be validated
- Use while loops to re-prompt for invalid inputs

2. **Error Handling**:
- Provide clear error messages
- Handle edge cases (empty inputs, wrong formats)

3. **Code Style**:
- Follow PEP 8 conventions
- Use descriptive variable names
- Add comments for complex logic

4. **Testing**:
- Test all menu options
- Verify edge cases work properly
- Ensure program doesn't crash on invalid inputs
